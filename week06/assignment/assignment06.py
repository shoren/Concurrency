'''
Requirements
1. Finish the team06 assignment (if necessary).
2. Change your program to process all 300 images using 1 CPU, then 2 CPUs, all the way up to the
   number of CPUs on your computer plus 4.
3. Keep track of the time it takes to process all 300 images per CPU.
4. Plot the time to process vs the number of CPUs.
   
Questions:
1. What is the relationship between the time to process versus the number of CPUs?
   Does there appear to be an asymptote? If so, what do you think the asymptote is?

   >
2. Is this a CPU bound or IO bound problem? Why?
   >
   >
3. Would threads work on this assignment? Why or why not? (guess if you need to) 
   >
   >
4. When you run "create_final_video.py", does it produce a video with the elephants
   inside of the screen?
