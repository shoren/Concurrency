'''
Requirements
1. Create a multiprocessing program that reads in files with defined tasks to perform.
2. The program should use a process pool per task type and use apply_async calls with callback functions.
3. The callback functions will store the results in global lists based on the task to perform.
4. Once all 4034 tasks are done, the code should print out each list and a breakdown of 
   the number of each task performed.
   
Questions:
1. How many processes did you specify for each pool:
   >Finding primes:
   >Finding words in a file:
   >Changing text to uppercase:
   >Finding the sum of numbers:
   >Web request to get names of Star Wars people:
   
   >How do you determine these numbers:
   
2. Specify whether each of the tasks is IO Bound or CPU Bound?
   >Finding primes:
   >Finding words in a file:
   >Changing text to uppercase:
   >Finding the sum of numbers:
   >Web request to get names of Star Wars people:
   
3. What was your overall time, with:
   >one process in each of your five pools:  ___ seconds
   >with the number of processes you show in question one:  ___ seconds
