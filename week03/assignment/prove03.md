# 03 Prove: Star Wars

## Overview

The python server in this assignment contains details of all of the Star Wars films.  You can access this information by making GET requests.  You will be retrieving the details of the 6th Star Wars film.

## Instructions

1. If you have cloned the class repo, then open the [assignment03.py](assignment03.py) file.
2. Your goal is to retrieve the information from the website as fast as you can.

**Coding Instructions**

- Each API call must only retrieve one piece of information
- Run the server.py program from a terminal/console program.  Simply type `python server.py`.  Note that you need the `data.txt` in the same folder as `server.py` in order for the server to work. 
- The only **fixed** or hard coded URL that you can use is TOP_API_URL.  Use this URL to retrieve other URLs that you can use to retrieve information from the server.
- You need to match the output outlined in the description of the assignment.
- You are required to use a threaded class (inherited from threading.Thread) for this assignment.  This object will make the API calls to the server. You can define your class within this Python file (ie., no need to have a separate file for the class).
- Do not add any global variables except for the ones included in this program.
- The main goal of the program is to create as many threads objects (in different parts of your program) as you can, then start them all, then wait for all of them to finish.

The call to TOP_API_URL will return the following Dictionary(JSON).  Do NOT have this dictionary hard coded - use the API call to get this.  Then you can use this dictionary to make other API calls for data.


## Required Output

The following is the **required** output of your assignment. Only the time should be different.

## How to use the requests package

There are a number of Python packages that can help you make URL calls.  We will be using the package `requests`.

### Install Package

This package needs to be installed.  Read the details on how to install packages in the `resources/software` section of the course.  Using pip, the command is `pip install requests`.  Using Python, it's `python -m pip install requests`.  (Mac users might need to use pip3)

### How to make an URL call to the server

```python
import requests
import json

# Const Values
TOP_API_URL = r'http://127.0.0.1:8790'

if __name__ == '__main__':

    response = requests.get(TOP_API_URL)
    
    # Check the status code to see if the request succeeded.
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        print(data)

		# Example to get person 1 url
        print('\nHere is the URL for person id = 1:', f'{data["people"]}1')
    else:
        print('Error in requesting ID')
```

Output:

```
{
    'people': 'http://127.0.0.1:8790/people/', 
    'planets': 'http://127.0.0.1:8790/planets/', 
    'films': 'http://127.0.0.1:8790/films/', 
    'species': 'http://127.0.0.1:8790/species/', 
    'vehicles': 'http://127.0.0.1:8790/vehicles/', 
    'starships': 'http://127.0.0.1:8790/starships/'
}

Here is the URL for person id = 1: http://127.0.0.1:8790/people/1
```
