'''
Requirements
1. Write a multithreaded program that calls a local web server. The web server is 
   provided to you. It will return data about the Star Wars movies.
2. You will make 94 calls to the web server, using 94 threads to get the data.
3. Using a new thread each time, obtain a list of the characters, planets, 
   starships, vehicles, and species of the sixth Star Wars movie.
3. Use the provided print_film_details function to print out the data 
   (should look exactly like the "sample_output.txt file).
   
Questions:
1. Is this assignment an IO Bound or CPU Bound problem (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/868568/what-do-the-terms-cpu-bound-and-i-o-bound-mean)?
    >
2. Review dictionaries (see https://isaaccomputerscience.org/concepts/dsa_datastruct_dictionary). How could a dictionary be used on this assignment to improve performance?
