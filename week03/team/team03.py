"""
Purpose: Drawing with Python Turtle

The follow program will draw a series of shapes - squares, circles, triangles
and rectangles.  

There is a Python class called SlowTurtle that is used to hold the drawing
commands that are created by the program.  This is required because threads can
not draw to the screen - only the main thread can do this.

Instructions:

- Find the "TODO" comment below and add your code that will use threads.
- No global variables necessary.
- Run the program before doing anything and watch it draw the turtle shapes in order.
- Your goal is to modify the code to get the shapes to draw in concurrently. This 
  does not mean that they will draw in parallel. Why can't they draw in parallel?
  Walk through the slow_turtles file and notice what the code is doing and not
  doing. It is not actually drawing to the screen. Instead, it is make a list of 
  drawing commands. Your goal is to make threads that all put their drawing commands
  into the list. Then, after the list is complete, the commands are given to the
  build-in Turtle class and drawn to the screen. 

- You will need to use Locks to get this to work. Why? Where should the locks go? Discuss with your team.
