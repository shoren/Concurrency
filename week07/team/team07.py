'''
Requirements
1. Write a multithreaded/multiprocessing program that counts the number of prime numbers 
   contained within a data file.
2. Create one thread to read each number from the data file and put the number on the queue.
3. Create n number of processes, where n is equal to the number of cpu/cores on your computer.
4. The processes will pop each number off of the queue and check if it is prime. If it is
   prime increment a "counter" (use an appropriate multiprocessing data structure).
5. Assert that the number of prime numbers found is correct.

Questions to consider with your Team:
1. Does increasing the number of processes beyond your cpu count decrease the time it takes
   to find the prime numbers? Why or why not?
2. What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of using processes over threads?
