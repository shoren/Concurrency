'''
Requirements
1. Using multiple threads, put cars onto a shared queue, with one or more thread consuming
   the items from the queue and one or more thread producing the items.
2. The size of queue should never exceed 10.
3. Do not call queue size to determine if maximum size has been reached. This means
   that you should not do something like this: 
        if q.size() < 10:
   Use the blocking semaphore function 'acquire'.
4. Produce a Plot of car count vs queue size (okay to use q.size since this is not a
   condition statement).
5. The number of cars produced by the manufacturer must equal the number of cars bought by the 
   dealership. Use necessary data objects (e.g., lists) to prove this. There is an assert in 
   main that must be used.
   
Questions:
1. How would you define a barrier in your own words?
   >
   >
2. Why is a barrier necessary in this assignment?
